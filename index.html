        Rabindranath Tagore, Bengali Rabindranath Thakur, (born May 7, 1861,<a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata">Calcutta</a> [now Kolkata], India-died August 7, 1941,
        Calcutta), Bengali poet, short-story writer, song composer, playwright, essayist, and painter who introduced new
        prose and verse forms and the use of colloquial language into <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengali_literature">Bengali literature</a>, thereby freeing it from
        traditional models based on classical Sanskrit. He was highly influential in introducing Indian culture to the
        West and vice versa, and he is generally regarded as the outstanding creative artist of early 20th-century <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India">India</a>. In 1913 he became the first non-European to receive
        the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize">Nobel Prize</a> for Literature.

        The son of the religious reformer Debendranath Tagore, he early began to write verses, and, after incomplete
        studies in England in the late 1870s, he returned to India. There he published several books of poetry in the
        1880s and completed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manasi_(poetry_collection)">Manasi</a> (1890), a collection that marks the maturing of his genius. It contains some of his
        best-known poems, including many in verse forms new to Bengali, as well as some social and political satire that
        was critical of his fellow Bengalis.

        In 1891 Tagore went to East Bengal (now in Bangladesh) to manage his family's estates at Shilaidah and Shazadpur
        for 10 years. There he often stayed in a houseboat on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padma_River">Padma River</a> (the main channel of the Ganges River), in
        close contact with village folk, and his sympathy for them became the keynote of much of his later writing. Most
        of his finest short stories, which examine "humble lives and their small miseries," date from the 1890s and have
        a poignancy, laced with gentle irony, that is unique to him (though admirably captured by the director Satyajit
        Ray in later film adaptations). Tagore came to love the Bengali countryside, most of all the Padma River, an
        often-repeated image in his verse. During these years he published several poetry collections, notably <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonar_Tori">Sonar Tari </a>
        (1894; The Golden Boat), and plays, notably Chitrangada (1892; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chitra_(play)">Chitra</a>). Tagore's poems are virtually
        untranslatable, as are his more than 2,000 songs, which achieved considerable popularity among all classes of
        Bengali society.

        In 1901 Tagore founded an experimental school in rural West Bengal at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiniketan">Shantiniketan</a> ("Abode of Peace"), where he
        sought to blend the best in the Indian and Western traditions. He settled permanently at the school, which
        became Visva-Bharati University in 1921. Years of sadness arising from the deaths of his wife and two children
        between 1902 and 1907 are reflected in his later poetry, which was introduced to the West in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gitanjali">Gitanjali</a> (Song
        Offerings) (1912). This book, containing Tagore's English prose translations of religious poems from several of
        his Bengali verse collections, including Gitanjali (1910), was hailed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._B._Yeats">W.B. Yeats</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Gide">Andre Gide</a> and won him
        the Nobel Prize in 1913. Tagore was awarded a knighthood in 1915, but he repudiated it in 1919 as a protest
        against the Amritsar (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jallianwala_Bagh_massacre">Jallianwalla Bagh Massacre</a>).
    </p>

        From 1912 Tagore spent long periods out of India, lecturing and reading from his work in Europe, the Americas,
        and East Asia and becoming an eloquent spokesperson for the cause of Indian independence. Tagore's novels in
        Bengali are less well known than his poems and short stories; they include Gora (1910) and Ghare-Baire (1916),
        translated into English as Gora and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Home_and_the_World">The Home and the World</a>, respectively. In the late 1920s, when he was in his
        60s, Tagore took up painting and produced works that won him a place among India's foremost contemporary
        artists.
